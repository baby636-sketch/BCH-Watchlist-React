A Watchlist app to track the balance of different Bitcoin Cash addresses with the option to give each one a name!

Here is the live version of the project, deployed with Netlify: [BCH Watchlist](https://bch-watchlist-react.netlify.app/).

The app uses local storage to persist the watchlist data so it's still there next time you return.

This is a rewrite using react of [this project](https://bch-watchlist.netlify.app/) which used vanilla JS for rendering.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Made with [Bch-js](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-js) and [qrcode.react](https://github.com/zpao/qrcode.react).
